# Pitchfork Album Review Analysis

This is an analysis of 18,393 Pitchfork album reviews taken from kaggle. The
idea is to see how text features could be used to predict various qualities of
the album being reviewed.

# Libraries Used

The Pipfile has a complete listing, but the libraries used include:

* kaggle: Kaggle API wrapper to fetch the data.
* numpy: Array processing functions.
* pandas: Dataframe organization of data.
* matplotlib: Producing plots. Tied to 3.0.3 to resolve an issue with the matrix
plots.
* seaborn: For the matrix plots.
* nltk: Tokenizing and stemming the reviews.
* sklearn: Machine learning algorithms (SVM, PCA, Lasso)
* jupyter: jupyter notebook.
* pycodestyle, flake8, pycodestyle-magic: Source code format checking.

# Files

## Files needed to run the analysis:

* README.md: This file.
* Pipfile and Pipfile.lock: pipenv files. Use pipenv to download libraries and
create a virtualenv.
* get_data.sh: Script to fetch data from kaggle.
* Pipfile, Pipfile.lock: Fetch libraries using pipenv.
* 'Pitchfork Review Data Analysis.ipynb': Analysis notebook.

## Files generated by the analysis:

* database.sqlite: The database of reviews, not kept under version control.
* terms_from_lasso.csv: csv file of words strongly correlated to score, found
using LASSO.
* genres_by_pca.pdf: Graph of genre categories plotted by the first two PCA
components.
* score_by_pca.pdf: Graph of score plotted by the first two PCA compenents.
* class_svm.pdf: Confusion matrix generated by using SVM to classify genres.
* class_nb.pdf: Confusion matrix generated by using naive Bayes to classify
* genres.
* compressed_score_by_pca.pdf: New plot of scores vs PCA components derived from
the restricted set of words found using LASSO.
* score_dist.pdf: Distribution of scores for first, second, and third albums.
